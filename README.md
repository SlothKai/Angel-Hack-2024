As part of Angel Hack 2024, our team created and started Project Iter, a one stop volunteering search portal equipped with gamification features to encourage users to continue giving back and contributing to society!

## Problem Statement

### Social Responsibility

Singapore's high digital connectivity and active society are assets. Create a simple online hub for volunteer opportunities and community engagement, enhancing civic participation that facilitates volunteer opportunities and community engagement strengthening the social fabric.

## Solution

Iter, latin for 'journey' aims to encourage users to continue signing up for volunteering opportunities by gamifying their volunteer experience.
